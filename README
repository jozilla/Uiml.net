Uiml.net is a Uiml renderer for the .Net framework.  

It has support for the Gtk#, system.Windows.Forms and Wx.NET widget
sets.  It is still under heavy development, so building the code can
be challinging but it should work...


HOW TO BUILD THE CODE:
On Linux with mono: "make" in Uiml directory.
On MS Windows: mail me for the MS Developer Studio project files

HOW TO RUN:
uiml.net.exe will start a simple file open dialog

uiml.net.exe -uiml <myuimlfile> will render the file "myuimlfile".

uiml.net.exe -uiml <myuimlfile> -libs <mylib1.dll;mylib2.dll;...> to
link the user interface with mylib1,mylib2,...

uiml.net.exe -help for a full explanation

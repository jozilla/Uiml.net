HISTORY:
Prof. dr. Kris Luyten started the project in 2003. Uiml.net is written
in C# and can render a UIML description using different widget sets
and platforms. Fully supported toolkits include System.Windows.Forms,
System.Windows.Forms on the Compact.NET framework and Gtk#. We used to
have support for Wx.Net, but that backend is now deprecated. 
Jo Vermeulen and Jan Meskens also significantly contributed to the
code both during their studies and while working at Hasselt
University.

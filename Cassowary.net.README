Cassowary.net README
====================

Cassowary.net [1] is a port of the Cassowary constraint solving
toolkit [2] to the .NET platform. It is based on the Java version by
Greg J. Badros, which in turn is based on the Smalltalk version by
Alan Borning.

Context
-------

I originally created this software for my Masters thesis at the
University of Hasselt [3]. More information about my Masters thesis
can be found on my homepage [4].

Dependencies
------------

Cassowary.net only requires a .NET environment, such as the Microsoft
.NET platform, or the Mono implementation [5]. To compile
Cassowary.net with parsing support, the (freely available) Coco/R
parser generator [6] is required.

Acknowledgements
----------------

I would like to thank the people of the Constraints Research Group at
the University of Washington [7] for their original Cassowary solver.
Special thanks go to Greg J. Badros for taking the time to answer my
questions and providing useful insights in the behavior of the solver.

Furthermore, I wish to thank Markus LÃ¶berbauer, one of the Coco/R
developers, for helping me correct the constraint grammar.

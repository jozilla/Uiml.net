- Make examples and test test test
- Write unittests using the nunit package
- Switch to Nant files instead of Makefiles

Bugs:
=====
- The properties used in widget constructors can not be specified in
  the <part> section of the widget

- Fix presentation source: selecting a fragment by identifier is not
  possible yet:

Standard compliance:
====================

We should update our implementation to conform to the upcoming UIML
4.0 standard.

This section lists the tags that are not yet (fully) supported:
- restructure
- condition (single events are supported)
- equal
- op
- action (call and properties are supported)
- when-true
- when-false
- by-default
- restructure
- listener

Here are the tags that are mostly supported, but need to be checked to
assure that they confirm to the standard:

- template (union and cascade need more work)

TODO for Widget support:
========================

- Gtk#:
  - GtkMozEmbed
  - GStreamer would be great if its API becomes more stable
  - Add and test properties
  - Add and test events
- WxWindows:
  - Only some widgets are supported (e.g. Button, TextCtrl,...)
  - Only BoxSizer is supported for layout management 
- Qt#:
  - Everything

Interaction part:
=================

- Add support for .Net Remoting in the call element
- Add Support for WSDL UI creation

Experimental topics:
====================

- Add support for WSDL, XML-RPC and SOAP in the call element
- Generic Layout management module
- Emit code for behavioral conditions?
- Make a GUI builder like Glade
